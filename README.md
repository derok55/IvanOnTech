Projects for Ivan on Tech Academy

The goal of this program is to create a basic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game.

The user is given instructions in the header, and their input is controlled by only being able to click on 3 different buttons (one for rock, paper, or scissors). 

The majority of the functionality is broken into 3 different sections in the code: what happens when you would click each one of the 3 buttons.

The result is to:
  1. Tell you what the computer chose
  2. Tell you whether or not you won, tied, or lost
  3. Keep a running tally of your wins, losses, ties, and winning percentage.
